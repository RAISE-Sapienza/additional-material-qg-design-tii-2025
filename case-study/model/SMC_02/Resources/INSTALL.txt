For Linux
=========

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

For Windows
===========

Set up a Linux VM :)

Alternatively: something along the line of
- installing CMake https://cmake.org/install/
- installing a modern C++ compiler https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
- and then https://cmake.org/runningcmake/
