## Repository structure

This repository contains the following directories:

* `additional-experiments` - Additional experiments to complement the experimental analysis presented in the article.

* `case-study` - This directory contains the Modelica code of the heat network case study with the required libraries. 
    * `model` - Modelica code of the heat network.
    * `library` - Modelica code of the [Automation of Energy System](https://github.com/looms-polimi/Automation_of_Energy_Systems) library.


## Extended experimental analysis

This folder contains additional experiments that complete the experimental analysis proposed in the article.
