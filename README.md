# Simulation-Based Design of Industry-Size Control Systems with Formal Quality Guarantees (Additional Material)

The repository contains additional materials (i.e., the Modelica code of the heat network case study and furhter experiments) of the paper "Simulation-Based Design of Industry-Size Control Systems with Formal Quality Guarantees" published in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics. 


## Structure

This repository contains the following directories:

    `additional-experiments` - Additional experiments to complement the experimental analysis presented in the paper.

    `case-study` - This directory contains the Modelica code of the heat network case study witn the required libraries. 


## Additional Experiments.

This folder contains an additional experiments that completes the experimental analysis proposed in the paper.

Further details are provided [here](additional-experiments/README.md).


## Case Study

This folder contains the Modelica code of the case study with which the approach proposed in the paper has been evaluated.

Further details and the instructions to simulate it are provided [here](case-study/README.md)
