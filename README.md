# Simulation-Based Design of Industry-Size Control Systems with Formal Quality Guarantees (Additional Material)

The repository contains additional materials (i.e., the Modelica code of the heat network case study and further experiments) from the paper "Simulation-Based Design of Industry-Size Control Systems with Formal Quality Guarantees", published in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics. 


## Structure

This repository contains the following directories:

* `additional-experiments` - Additional experiments to complement the experimental analysis presented in the paper.

* `case-study` - This directory contains the Modelica code of the heat network case study with the required libraries. 
    * `model` - Modelica code of the heat network.
    * `library` - Modelica code of the [Automation of Energy System](https://github.com/looms-polimi/Automation_of_Energy_Systems) Modelica library.


## Additional Experiments.

This folder contains additional experiments that complete the experimental analysis proposed in the paper.

Further details are provided [here](additional-experiments/README.md).


## Case Study

This folder contains the Modelica code of the case study with which the approach proposed in the paper has been evaluated.

Further details and the instructions to simulate it are provided [here](case-study/README.md).
