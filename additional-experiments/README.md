# Additional experiments with several $\varepsilon$ an $\delta$.


In the following, we show an extension of the analysis presented in the paper of the time needed to compute the four Pareto-optimal Quality Guaranteed (QG-) controls denoted with blue squares.

Namely, such figures show the computation time breakdown among the Black-Box optimization (BBO) and the Statistical Model Checking (SMC) steps in each algorithm iteration (starting from the bottom) with the following values for $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$:

* All values of $\varepsilon\$ $\in$ { $10^{-3}, 2.5 \times 10^{-3}, 5 \times 10^{3}, 7.5 \times 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}$ }

* Three different (evenly spaced) values of $\delta$, *i.e.* { $10^{-3}, 5 \times 10^{3}, 10^{-2}$ }.


Below, we provide three figures (one figure per $\delta$) that show the experiments for all values for $\varepsilon$ with that $\delta$:

*  $\delta$ $=$ $10^{-3}$ ([figure](figures/additional_experiments_delta0.01.pdf))
*  $\delta = 5 \times 10^{3}$ ([figure](figures/additional_experiments_delta0.005.pdf))
*  $\delta = 10^{3}$ ([figure](figures/additional_experiments_delta0.001.pdf))
