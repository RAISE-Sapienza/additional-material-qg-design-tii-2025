# Additional experiments with several $\varepsilon$ an $\delta$.


In the following, we show an extension of the analysis presented in the paper, of the time needed to compute the four Pareto-optimal Quality Guaranteed (QG-) controls denoted with blue squares.

Namely, such figures show the computation time breakdown, among the Black-Box optimization (BBO) and the Statistical Model Checking (SMC) steps in each algorithm iteration (starting from the bottom), for all values of $\varepsilon \in \{ 1e-3, 2.5e-3, 5e-3, 7.5e-3, 1e-2 \}$ and three different (evenly spaced) values of $\delta$, *i.e.* $\{1e-3, 5e-3, 1e-2\}$.
